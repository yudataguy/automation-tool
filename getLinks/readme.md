# getLinks #

### Language ###
Python

### Function ###
Open specific links on certain page. 

### Purpose ###
I open some links on webpage on daily basis. Therefore it is more efficient to write a python program to incrase productivity. 

### Version ###
This version only requires basic python packages. I have another version built with [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/), will release it at a later time.

### Usage ###
`python getlinks.py`

If you'd like to make the script clickable (MacOS), use the `getlinks.command`, make sure to set the permission `chmod u+x getlinks.command` before running.
